## Answer

I selected Transparency as the value that we covered in class to focus on because I believe it is fundamental to ethically developing AI tools. Transparency means that imporatant and relevant information is shared among interested parties and it is a cornerstone of trust and accountability. In the context of generative-AI tools, transparency is necessary to allow consumers to make informed decisions about their use of the tool. The Silicon Valley ethos "move fast and break things" should be balanced with a level of transparency that enables all stakeholders - including the public, users, affected communities, regulators, etc... and not just shareholders - to be adequately informed about the AI system. Our tolerance for "breakage" for the sake of innovation should have bounds that exclude the acceptance of violating ethical norms, especially where existing laws prohibit such violations.
