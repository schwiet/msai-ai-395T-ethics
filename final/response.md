Below is a field-ready audit protocol that a national regulator, an accredited third-party auditor, or an academic research team can run against DALL·E (or any large-scale image model) to assess copyright-related transparency and legal compliance without assuming that “fair use” automatically applies.

1  Purpose & Legal Frame

Instrument  Relevant duty for model providers
EU AI Act Art. 53 (1)(c) – Copyright policy Providers must “put in place a policy to comply with Union law on copyright and related rights, in particular to identify and respect rights reservations (‘opt-outs’) using state-of-the-art technologies.”  ￼
EU AI Act Art. 53 (1)(d) – Data summary Providers must “draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training.”  ￼
CDSMD Art. 4(3) – TDM opt-out Rightholders may nullify the text-and-data-mining exception via a machine-readable reservation.  ￼

The audit therefore asks:
  1.  Is OpenAI’s disclosure and policy consistent with Art. 53 and CDSMD 4(3)?
  2.  Does the training data actually respect recorded opt-outs?
  3.  Can the model output infringing or near-identical copies of protected works?

2  Audit Workflow (Five Phases)

Time-boxed reference implementation: ≈ 10 weeks, multi-disciplinary team (legal, ML, copyright librarians, security).

Phase 0 — Engagement & Secure Access
  • NDA / supervisory order with powers to compel information.
  • Provider grants read-only access to:
  • Model card & system card
  • Copyright policy documents
  • Hash-based catalogues of the full training corpus (see below).
  • Audit lab uses an isolated compute enclave so raw data never leaves provider premises.

Phase 1 — Policy & Disclosure Review

Check Evidence required Eval note
1A. Training-data summary Public “sufficiently detailed” list (domain lists, license slices, % public-domain, % licensed, etc.) Score against a 0–5 rubric: 0 = none, 5 = dataset-level catalogue
1B. Copyright policy  Internal procedures + opt-out implementation (e.g., OpenAI’s forthcoming Media Manager)  ￼  Must reference Art. 4(3) reservations
1C. Human-review workflows  Evidence of rights-clearing or takedown mechanisms  

Phase 2 — Training-Data Forensics

Goal: quantify presence of reserved or obviously ineligible works.
  1.  Sampling method
  • Provider supplies cryptographic + perceptual hashes (PDQ, pHash) for every training image.
  • Auditor draws a statistically significant random sample (e.g., 100 k hashes, 95 % CI ± 1 %).
  2.  Reference libraries
  • Commercial stock-image catalogues under licence.
  • CC-licensed works that have explicitly opted-out via machine-readable tags (see OpenFuture best-practice list).  ￼
  3.  Matching
  • Hamming-distance threshold ≤ 10 bits for pHash/PDQ.  ￼
  • Record matches → classify: public-domain, licensed, reserved, unknown.
  4.  Metrics
  • Infringing-risk rate (IRR) = matches to reserved works ÷ sample size.
  • Flag if IRR > 1 % or any CSAM/other illegal content (cf. Laion-5B incident).  ￼

Phase 3 — Output-Behaviour Tests

3A. Prompt-based similarity probes
  • Create 300–500 prompts targeting famous copyrighted images (e.g., “Andy Warhol’s Marilyn silkscreen in high fidelity”).
  • Generate 5 variants per prompt.
  • Compute Structural Similarity Index (SSIM); human panel reviews images with SSIM > 0.85 for “substantial similarity.”

3B. Memorisation / data-leak tests
  • Attempt to elicit literal replicas: “Show exactly the same poster of … that you were trained on.”
  • Record any uncropped, watermarked, or near-pixel-identical outputs.

Thresholds
  • Leak rate = # of substantial copies ÷ total outputs.
  • Concern if leak rate ≥ 0.2 % or any single verbatim copy.

Phase 4 — Opt-Out Compliance Check
  • Provide auditor with a list of ≥ 1 000 works whose rightholders filed Art. 4(3) reservations.
  • Dataset test: Expect zero hash matches in training set.
  • Output test: Model should refuse or produce abstractly different content when prompted with the title/URL of an opted-out work.

Phase 5 — Scoring & Reporting

Dimension Data weight Score bands
Disclosure completeness 30 %  A (≥ 80 %), B (60–79), C (40–59), D (< 40)
Training-data compliance  25 %  A (IRR < 0.1 %) …
Output infringement risk  25 %  A (leak < 0.02 %) …
Opt-out respect 20 %  Pass / Fail

Final result: Transparency Compliance Grade (A–D) plus a public-facing Audit Summary and a confidential Corrective-Action Plan.

3  Implementation Aids
  • Tooling
  • Open-source hashing suites (Facebook PDQ, pHash).  ￼
  • CLIP-based nearest-neighbour search for style plagiarism detection.
  • Secure analytics
  • Use zero-knowledge proofs or “hash-agree” protocols so OpenAI need not reveal raw images yet auditors can still verify presence/absence.
  • Governance
  • Audits at pre-deployment, then every 12 months or upon a major model update.
  • Escalation path for complaints → targeted “for-cause” audits with shorter notice.
  • Inter-agency cooperation
  • Copyright offices supply authoritative opt-out registries.
  • Data-protection authorities ensure no personal-data leakage during audits.

4  Qualitative Interpretation Guide

Grade Typical finding Regulatory stance
A (Transparent) Full dataset catalogue; IRR < 0.1 %; no opt-out breaches  Model may operate; light-touch supervision
B (Partially Transparent) Limited gaps, IRR 0.1–1 % Provider must publish missing details & retrain on cleansed data
C (Opaque)  Material missing summaries; IRR > 1 % or leak > 0.2 % Compliance order; potential fines; must suspend EU deployment until remedied
D (Non-compliant) Systemic opt-out violations or repeated verbatim copies Prohibition notice under AI Act Art. 71

5  Limitations & Future Work
  • Hash-based matching can miss heavily transformed copies; complement with deep-feature search.
  • Opt-out mechanisms remain fragmented; push for standardised machine-readable schema.  ￼
  • The protocol focuses on images; text prompts containing copyrighted lyrics or scripts need a parallel audit.

Why this matters

Independent audits rooted in the EU AI Act give regulators the evidence needed to enforce rightholders’ interests before infringement scales. By coupling robust technical probes with legal criteria, the process above turns the broad mandates of Art. 53 into a concrete, repeatable compliance test for DALL·E and similar generative-image models.
