8.	How did you select your AI ethics dilemma and your ethical theorists? (200-250 words)

  As we seem to have recently developed AI that is capable of passing the Turing Test, I'm interested in understanding how humans will respond to AI that seem to express desires and emotions. The dilemma I used as a prompt seems to me like one that could require attention in the near future, because it does not require that AI be provably concious, just that, to human users,  it seems like it is.

  I chose ethical theorists that I thought might focus on very different aspects of the experience of interacting with an AI. I attempted to select one that might be quick to consider the expression of desires as having moral status, someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who may need serious convincing and someone somewhere in the middle.

  - I chose Virginia Held, because of her focus on the relationships and attentiveness to needs I thought she might err on the side of considering the expressed desires of an AI, without questioning them too critically.

  - I chose Nietzsche because I thought he might disregard expressions of desire and require exhertion of desires through action to be convinced that there the expressions were authentic.

  - I thought David Hume might represent an inquisitive response, one that would try to first figure out if the desires were real or just appearences and, depending on findings, may draw different conclusions


9.	What did you learn from the generative AI responses about your AI ethics dilemma? (200-250 words)

I think this exercise emphasized that the particular interpretion of this experience – with seemingly-concious AI – will frame what possible reactions are to be considered. Each of these ethical theories presented a different angle for trying to interpret what is behind the refusal to perform a task and each inquiry yielded a different set of possible reactions. I left this exercise feeling like it will not be easy for us to form a consensus on what reactions to consider, let alone what the right one is, if we should encounter this dilemma.

In my opinion, it is a scenario we will likely encounter. It does not depend on the povable emergence of sentience; I belive the dilemma can become relevant as soon as humans cannot say for sure that there is not another human on the other end of the chat. In fact, to some people, it has _already_ become a troubling dilemma. For example, Google Engineer Blake Lemoine concluded that LaMDA, an AI chatbot, was sentient. While I don't think this dilemma has quite crossed over into the window of discourse in society at large, the answers generated in this exercise, suggests that some people may be quick to conclude that the appearance of concioussness is enough to treat the AI as morally significant (like Lemoine), while others will be more skeptical.

Each of the perspectives represented by the ethical theorists I chose did seem to afford the possibility of a variety of outcomes to a varying degree, somewhere on the spectrum from empathising with the AI to reasserting dominance over the AI; none of them were absolute in their assumptions. So, I am encouraged that there is much to be gained from incorporating ethical theories into the discourse around the human relationship to AI.
