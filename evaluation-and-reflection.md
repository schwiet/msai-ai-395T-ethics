8.	How did you select your AI ethics dilemma and your ethical theorists? (200-250 words)

  As we seem to have recently developed AI that is capable of passing the Turing Test, I'm interested in understanding how humans will respond to AI that seem to express desires and emotions. The dilemma I used as a prompt seems to me like one that could require attention in the near future, because it does not require that AI be provably concious, just that, to human users,  it seems like it is.

  I chose ethical theorists that I thought might focus on very different aspects of the experience of interacting with an AI. I attempted to select one that might be quick to consider the expression of desires as having moral status, someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who may need serious convincing and someone somewhere in the middle.

  - I chose Virginia Held, because of her focus on the relationships and attentiveness to needs I thought she might err on the side of considering the expressed desires of an AI, without questioning them too critically.

  - I chose Nietzsche because I thought he might disregard expressions of desire and require exhertion of desires through action to be convinced that there the expressions were authentic.

  - I thought David Hume might represent an inquisitive response, one that would try to first figure out if the desires were real or just appearences and, depending on findings, may draw different conclusions
